            <span class="left">Hii Bhavani.. </span>
            <span class="right">Hi Chaitra</span>
            <span class="left">Hey! Whatâ€™s up? ðŸ˜Š</span>
            <span class="right">Hey! Not much, just chilling. You?</span>
            <span class="left">Same here. Did you watch the new episode of that series we love?</span>
            <span class="right">Yes! Omg, it was so good. That plot twist at the end! ðŸ˜²</span>
            <span class="left">I know, right?! I didnâ€™t see that coming at all.</span>
            <span class="right">Neither did I. What do you think will happen next?</span>
            <span class="left">Hmm, I think the main character might team up with the antagonist.</span>
            <span class="right">Interesting theory. I think they might introduce a new character.</span>
            <span class="left">That would be cool too. By the way, are we still on for Saturday?</span>
            <span class="right">Yes, absolutely! I canâ€™t wait. What time should we meet?</span>
            <span class="left">How about 3 PM at the usual place?</span>
            <span class="right">Sounds perfect. See you then!</span>
            <span class="left">Great! See you on Saturday! ðŸ˜Š</span>
            <span class="right">Bye!</span>
            <h5 class="date">July 25, 2024</h5>
            <span class="left">Hey, I found this amazing cafÃ© today. We should check it out sometime!</span>
            <span class="right">Oh, that sounds fun! Where is it?</span>
            <span class="left">Itâ€™s downtown, near the library. They have the best coffee and pastries.</span>
            <span class="right">Yum! Letâ€™s plan a visit next week?</span>
            <span class="left">Definitely! Iâ€™ll look up their hours.</span>
            <h5 class="date">July 26, 2024</h5>
            <span class="right">Guess what? I got tickets to the concert next month!</span>
            <span class="left">No way! Thatâ€™s awesome! Whoâ€™s performing?</span>
            <span class="right">The band we love, remember? Itâ€™s going to be epic!</span>
            <span class="left">I canâ€™t wait! This is going to be so much fun.</span>
            <h5 class="date">July 27, 2024</h5>
            <span class="right">Hey, have you started the new book we bought?</span>
            <span class="left">Yes, Iâ€™m halfway through it. Itâ€™s so good!</span>
            <span class="right">Iâ€™m loving it too. The characters are so well-written.</span>
            <span class="left">Totally! Letâ€™s discuss it when we both finish.</span>
            <h5 class="date">Yesterday</h5>
            <span class="right">Morning! Donâ€™t forget about our movie night tonight!</span>
            <span class="left">Of course not! Iâ€™ve got the popcorn ready. What movie are we watching?</span>
            <span class="right">I was thinking we could watch that new sci-fi one. It looks amazing.</span>
            <span class="left">Sounds perfect! See you at 7 PM.</span>
            <h5 class="date">Today</h5>
            <span class="right">How was your day?</span>
            <span class="left">Busy but good. How about yours?</span>
            <span class="right">Pretty relaxed. I did some reading and went for a walk.</span>
            <span class="left">Nice! Iâ€™m looking forward to our weekend plans.</span>
